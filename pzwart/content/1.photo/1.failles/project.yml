 "Of course, the familiar experience of what we see most often seems to give rise to an asset: in seeing something, we generally feel as if we have gained something. But the modality of the visible becomes inevitable - that is to say, doomed to be a matter of being - when to see is to feel that something inevitably escapes us, in other words: when seeing blinds us."
 
  George Didi-Huberman, in Ce Que Nous Voyons, Ce Qui Nous Regarde (Ã‰ditions de Minuit, 1992).
